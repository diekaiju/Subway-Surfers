# 🏃‍♂️ Subway Surfers PC Native Controls Patcher

Welcome! This repository hosts a native controls patcher for the PC version of Subway Surfers. It injects keyboard input handling, restores missions, ensures null-safe daily words, and patches run sequences directly into the game's assembly using `Mono.Cecil`.
